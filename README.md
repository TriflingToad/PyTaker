# Backstory
This was made for my Intro to Computer Science Prenciples final and it took me about 15 hours of work combined over ~10 days with a winter break in the middle. When I came back I decided to completely wipe most of it and change what I was making 1 last time. Inittaly I thought I was going to make Minesweeper, then it turned to Snake when I made the boxes move. Then somehow it turned to Tetris, a maze game, helltaker as ASCII then helltaker with emojis.  

Features: 
* startup sequence
* pushing objects
* move count
* reset button
* collision with walls
* a dialogue with a NPC once you solve the puzzle
    * handwritten descriptions of the NPC
    * a win *and* lose condition for the NPC
