# Do YOU want to play a free game but worse in every possible way?  
boy, do I have the 300 line python project for you!

This is PyTaker. A version of the first level of [Helltaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/) but made with ONLY Emojis!

This was made for my Intro to Computer Science Prenciples final and it took me about 10 hours of work combined over 3 days. Inittaly I thought I was going to make Minesweeper, then it turned to Snake when i made the boxes move. But then I'd have to deal with the complicated nature of the tail, and I didn't want to deal with that. I could have made a maze, but I already did that, so instead I chose to make an even MORE complicated maze game. Hope you enjoy, if anybody finds this ever.
